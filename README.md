# The Autark Engine Monorepo

Post-Modern Analytical Processing Engine.

Autark is an idiosyncratic approach of my own to the problem of dataframes in particular and analytical processing writ large.
It attempts to defy orthodox practices in query engines and intermediate storage.
The contemporary computational engine is a quasi-compiler which compiles to Tinygrad UOps.

The contemporary source code is pre-alpha, There exists much work to be done, namely *sane, tangible, testing*, implementation of additional OPs, and better I/O primitives. At sufficent maturity, a Python interface would be constructed.

The project is at a teriffically early stage, and there exists a high chance many refactors and or breaking interface modifications be done.
Irrespectively, contributions are welcome.

While there exist no absolute restrictions, presently I dissent clearly AI-Generated Pull Requests. I personally found AI is yet to be effective in said work, I hope this would change.
